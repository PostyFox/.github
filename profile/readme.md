## What is this project?

Initially giving the capability for people to author posts in PostyBirb and schedule them for posting at a later date (offloaded into the cloud).

## Why not do this as part of the main PostyBirb project?

PostyBirb is about to kick off the v4 rebuild, and is already a massive project. There is not much dev resource there as it is, and not much appetite to push on with a web based version - partly around the aspect of being concerned around security and cost, but also the need to have a lot of ongoing maintenance for it. Doing this as a seperate project allows it to be ran in tandom, giving the best of both worlds.
